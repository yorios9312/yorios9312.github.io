    <div id="about">
      <p id="aboutme"><img id="me2" class="center-block img-responsive img-rounded" src="images/Manuela.png" alt="me"> It all started when I was eight and wanted to showcase my Christmas list as a Powerpoint rather than writing a regular letter that I knew that I was a bit different from my peers. My father majored in Systems Engineering and my mother majored in Journalism with a minor in Art History, so my activities were always demonstrating the flow between both sides of my brain. In third grade I started drumming, in seventh grade I was jailbreaking my friends' iPods, and in high school I was taking formal computer science courses.
      <br><br>
      College was the perfect time for me to figure out how I was going to incorporate my seemingly random talents into one major. While I started as a Computer Science major, there was always an element that was missing for me. When I took my first Human-Computer Interaction class, I knew that HCI was exactly what I had been looking for. I was able to talk to the end-users, design prototypes, and code the final product. Nothing kept me more enaged than being able to contribute at every stage of the product cycle. Throughout my time at Cornell, I was also lucky enough to take on a few leadership positions. I was the president of my sorority, Alpha Epsilon Phi, a teaching assistant for three different courses, and the executive editor of Cornell's humor magazine. 
      <br><br>
      After my junior year, I interned at Whisper as a Product Manager, and I knew from that experience that I wanted to keep growing as a PM in my full-time job. After deciding to graduate from Cornell University a semester early, I accepted an offer from FiscalNote as an Associate Product Manager, and I will start in their Washington, D.C. office in March!</p>
